> 🧠 **Start from a portfolio holding → let a nine-agent TradingAgents research team analyze it → follow the bull/bear debate and risk review → receive a PM decision memo and the complete reasoning trail in your messaging app within 3–5 minutes.**

## Why PanWatch?

- **Private by design** — self-host it so portfolio data remains under your control.
- **Action-oriented AI** — turn market data, news, technical signals, and portfolio context into concrete watch items instead of another indicator dashboard.
- **Always on** — schedule pre-market, intraday, and closing agents, then deliver results through Telegram, WeCom, DingTalk, Feishu, Bark, or webhooks.
- **Multi-market and model-agnostic** — monitor China A-shares, Hong Kong, and U.S. stocks with OpenAI-compatible providers, including local models through Ollama.

## 🧠 Deep Analysis with TradingAgents

PanWatch integrates [TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents), the multi-agent investment decision framework with more than 76k stars. Select the 🧠 icon next to a portfolio holding to start an analysis:

- **Four analyst roles** — technical, sentiment, news, and fundamentals — followed by a **bull/bear debate**, **risk review**, and **portfolio-manager decision**.
- A complete reasoning trail is generated in 3–5 minutes and can be delivered to Telegram, WeCom, or DingTalk.
- The default model is `deepseek-chat`; a typical run costs about USD 0.05, keeping monthly spending predictable.

| **Daily report** | After market close | Reviews the session, analyzes capital flows, and prepares a plan for the next trading day. |

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Professional technical analysis</b></summary>

- **Trend indicators:** moving-average alignment, MACD crosses, and Bollinger Band breakouts.
- **Momentum indicators:** RSI overbought/oversold conditions and KDJ saturation or divergence.
- **Price and volume:** volume-ratio anomalies, low-volume pullbacks, and high-volume breakouts.
- **Pattern recognition:** hammer, engulfing, doji, and other candlestick patterns.
- **Support and resistance:** automatic calculation of multiple support and resistance levels.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multiple markets and accounts</b></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-channel notifications</b></summary>

Telegram / WeCom / DingTalk / Feishu / Bark / custom webhooks

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Price alerts</b></summary>

- Combine price, percentage change, turnover, volume ratio, and other conditions with AND/OR logic.
- Limit rules to market hours or keep them active all day; configure cooldowns, daily trigger limits, and repeat behavior.
- Set an expiration date and `HH:mm` time in the rule dialog, or leave it empty so the rule never expires.
- Choose notification channels per rule, or use the system default when none is selected.

</details>

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name panwatch \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v panwatch_data:/app/data \
  sunxiao0721/panwatch:latest
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`, create your username and password, and connect an OpenAI-compatible provider. PanWatch selects English or Simplified Chinese from the browser language on first visit.

The image includes the system dependencies required by Playwright. Chromium is downloaded and installed into the mounted volume (by default `/app/data/playwright`) on the first container startup. This can take a few minutes and requires network access.

If you do not need browser-based features such as screenshots, set `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_INSTALL=1` when starting the container to skip the initial Chromium installation.

<details>
<summary>Docker Compose</summary>

```yaml
services:
  panwatch:
    image: sunxiao0721/panwatch:latest
    container_name: panwatch
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - panwatch_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  panwatch_data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Environment variables</summary>

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AUTH_USERNAME` | Preconfigured login username | Set on first visit |
| `AUTH_PASSWORD` | Preconfigured login password | Set on first visit |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to sign JWTs | Generated automatically |
| `DATA_DIR` | Data storage directory | `./data` |
| `TZ` | Application timezone used for agent schedules and displayed times | `Asia/Shanghai` |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_INSTALL` | Skip the initial Chromium installation when browser features are not required | Not set |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Console log level. `INFO` prints business events and errors; use `DEBUG` for scheduler heartbeats, collection steps, and other diagnostics. The UI log panel always retains the complete log. | `INFO` |
| `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `http_proxy` | Outbound HTTP proxy. Configure it through an external environment variable, `http_proxy=http://host:port` in `.env`, or **Settings → Global HTTP Proxy**. Priority: external environment variables > UI > `.env`. `NO_PROXY` includes `localhost,127.0.0.1` by default. | Not set |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OpenTelemetry OTLP endpoint, such as `http://jaeger:4318`. Export remains completely disabled when this is empty. The optional dependencies in `requirements-otel.txt` are also required. | Not set (disabled) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Initial setup</summary>

1. Open the web interface and create your login credentials.
2. Go to **Settings → AI Services** and configure an OpenAI-compatible API, such as OpenAI, Zhipu AI, DeepSeek, or Ollama.
3. Go to **Settings → Notification Channels** and add Telegram or another delivery channel.
4. Go to **Portfolio → Add Stock**, add a symbol to your watchlist, and enable the relevant agents.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Local development</summary>

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+ / Node.js 24.14.0 / pnpm 9.15.9

```bash
# One-command development setup (recommended)
make dev-api          # Backend with automatic venv/dependencies on :8000
make dev-web          # Frontend with automatic pnpm install on :5183

# Or start each service manually
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py                              # Backend on :8000

cd frontend && pnpm install && pnpm dev       # Frontend on :5183
```

The frontend development server runs at `http://localhost:5183` and proxies `/api` to `127.0.0.1:8000`.

Port `5183` is used instead of Vite's default `5173` to avoid conflicts with other locally running projects such as BeeCount-Cloud.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Technology stack</b></summary>

**Backend:** FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / APScheduler / OpenAI SDK

**Frontend:** React 18 / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS / shadcn/ui

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenTelemetry export (optional and disabled by default)</b></summary>

PanWatch includes a built-in observability stack with structured logs, end-to-end `trace_id` correlation, the `agent_runs` table, and node-level TradingAgents progress and cost reporting. It works without any external service.

You can optionally add standard [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) export and send traces to Jaeger, Tempo, Langfuse, or another compatible APM. PanWatch maps three types of spans:

- **One agent run** → a root span correlated with the `trace_id` from `agent_runs`.
- **One LLM call** → a `gen_ai` child span following the [OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/), including `gen_ai.system`, `gen_ai.request.model`, input/output token usage, and `gen_ai.operation.name`.
- **One TradingAgents node** → a child span that reuses the node-level progress callback.

Export is a complete no-op when the optional dependencies are not installed and no endpoint is configured.

Enable it in three steps:

```bash
# 1. Install the optional dependencies
pip install -r requirements-otel.txt

# 2. Configure your collector or APM endpoint
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=panwatch   # Optional; defaults to panwatch

# 3. Start PanWatch normally. The startup log will confirm that OTel export is enabled.
python server.py
```

Run a local Jaeger instance to verify the integration:

```bash
docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
# Trigger an agent, open http://localhost:16686, and select service=panwatch.
```

Langfuse and Tempo work the same way: point `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to their OTLP endpoint.

<details>
<summary><b>Publishing Docker images</b></summary>

The repository includes a GitHub Actions release workflow:

- Pushing a tag such as `0.2.3` automatically builds and publishes:
  - `sunxiao0721/panwatch:0.2.3`
  - `sunxiao0721/panwatch:latest`
- The workflow can also be started manually with `workflow_dispatch` and an explicit version.

Configure these repository secrets before publishing:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

</details>
